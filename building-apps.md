# Building a custom app
{: #build-your-own}

If you're not using a starter kit and know what you need, you can build your app with the resources you choose.
{: shortdesc}

## Choosing your language
{: #catalog}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog lists the infrastructure and platform resources available for use. You can start building your app by selecting a virtual machine, container, or Cloudant, a Cloud Foundry app. If you need platform resources, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also offers [boilerplates](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?taxonomyNavigation=apps&category=blueprints), which provide runtimes and other services to help you start building.

## Creating a resource
{: #resource}

1. In your [dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/), click **Create resource**.

2. From the catalog, select an app from the Platform section. Then, choose your runtime. For example, you can choose an IBM runtime environment, such as Liberty for Java, which is supported by IBM build packs. You can also choose Community runtimes, such as Tomcat, which relies on open source and third-party build packs.

  * [Getting started with Containers](../containers/container_index.html)
  * [Getting started with Openwhisk](../openwhisk/index.html)
  * [Creating Cloud Foundry apps](../cfapps/index.html#creating_cloud_foundry_apps)

3. Enter your app name, host name and choose your pricing plan.

4. Select your development style. You can edit your app in your preferred text editor and use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} command line to deploy it to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. You can also use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} DevOps Services to deploy your application from a browser or use Eclipse Tools for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} to work on applications in the Eclipse integrated development environment.

## Adding code
{: #code}

Each app comes with a getting started section that helps you get all the software and content you need to start working.

In your dashboard, click your app, and then click **Getting Started**, which can help you get the software you need to develop your app, point you to the source code, and help you deploy your app for the first time.

## Next steps
{: #next}

Continue to customize your app to fit your needs. Check out the following suggestions for extending your app to achieve business results:

* Make your app more robust by adding [security ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?taxonomyNavigation=data&category=security){:new_window}, [monitoring ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=devops){:new_window}, and availability improvements outlined in our [best practices](best-practice.html) guide.
* Make your app smarter with [Watson cognitive services ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?taxonomyNavigation=data&category=watson){:new_window} and [advanced analytics and machine learning](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?taxonomyNavigation=data&category=data){:new_window}.
* Go [mobile ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=mobile){:new_window}.
* Try out the [Internet of Things ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=iot){:new_window}.
* Use services such as [API Connect ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=integration){:new_window} to integrate [serverless actions ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=whisk){:new_window}.
