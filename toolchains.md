# DevOps toolchains
{: #devops-toolchains}

The DevOps toolchain comprises procedures and tools for accessing, developing, deploying, and operating your app. A DevOps toolchain is set of linked services that automates your DevOps tasks. Itâ€™s possible to perform DevOps manually with simple apps, but the need for automation increases quickly as app complexity increases, and toolchain automation is a must-have for continuous delivery.

The core component of a DevOps toolchain is a code version control repository like GitHub. More tools might include backlog tracking, delivery pipeline, IDE, and monitoring service like [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}](/docs/services/DevOpsInsights?topic=DevOpsInsights-getting-started).

If you create an app by using a starter kit, you can create a toolchain and deploy your app simply by clicking **Deploy to cloud** on the **App details** page. A toolchain that has a code repo, issues repo, delivery pipeline, and web IDE is created.

You can then build on this toolchain to accommodate multiple teams and deploy to separate environments for development, test, and production. You establish an enterprise-class collaborative continuous delivery model for your app.

For more information about continuous delivery, see the [Getting started tutorial](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd_getting_started).
