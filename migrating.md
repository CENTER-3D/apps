# Migrating your apps from other platforms
{: #migrating}

If you have an existing application, you can migrate it to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} incrementally instead of shifting your app to the cloud environment all at once.

If you need your app to access your on-premises data or services, you can use [{{site.data.keyword.SecureGatewayfull}}](/docs/services/SecureGateway?topic=securegateway-getting-started-with-sg#getting-started-with-sg) to establish a secured tunnel between an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} organization and your enterprise backend network.

If you need help with your migration, check out [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Migration Services](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/migration-services){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").
