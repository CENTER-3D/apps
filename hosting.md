# Hosting apps
{: #hosting}

If you have an existing app, you can host it on IBM Cloud with all the infrastructure or platform services you need. For existing apps, you take advantage of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure to host apps that you've developed specifically for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

## Migrating apps
{: #ht_hostapp}

For existing apps, you can migrate your apps to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} incrementally, instead of shifting the app completely to the cloud environment. You can migrate a portion of your app first and connect to the existing data or system of records by using the Cloud Integration service.

For your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} apps, you might need to access the back-end data or services, such as a system of record. In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you can use the Secure Gateway service to establish a secured tunnel between an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} organization and the enterprise backend network. The service enables the apps on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} to access the backend networkâ€™s data and services. For details, see [Reaching enterprise backend with Bluemix Secure Gateway via console ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/04/01/reaching-enterprise-backend-bluemix-secure-gateway/){: new_window}.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} can host your existing app and provide all the infrastructure you need. In the [catalog](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?taxonomyNavigation=apps), you can choose whether you host your app on a bare metal server or a virtual server. A [bare metal](../bare-metal/index.html#about-bare-metal-servers) deployment is best if you need a dedicated physical server for higher performance. A [virtual](/vsi/vsi_index.html#provisioning-a-virtual-server) deployment is best if your workload is spread out across geographic regions and you want to use an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} hypervisor to manage your deployments.

You can migrate parts of the app to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} all at once or component by component. Take a look at a few of the services we offer as you migrate your app.

* Select the type of [storage](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?taxonomyNavigation=apps&category=slstorage) that's right for you from block storage, file storage, or object storage.
* Select the type of [network](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?taxonomyNavigation=apps&category=slnetwork) you need.
* Select a [containerization](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?taxonomyNavigation=apps&category=containers) service to take advantage of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Kubernetes technology.

## Next steps
{: #next-steps}

If your service can be hosted in more than one region, you can select where your app is hosted. To do that, register and add your custom URL information in your app in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. Then, select the regions where your app is hosted. See [Updating apps](updapps.html) for more information about how to deploy your app.
