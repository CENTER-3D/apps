The starter kits {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides are available in many languages and frameworks. The language options that are found in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} starter kits match the particular use case that is addressed by the starter kit. For example, cloud microservice starter kits offer a node.js option, while starter kits closely related to data analysis might include Python or Go. Some common languages that are used in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} starter kits are discussed.

* [Java ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/runtimes/liberty/getting-started.html){: new_window}
{: #java notoc}

Java has proven capabilities for building enterprise-grade applications. But new capabilities in Java 8, combined with lighter weight runtimes like Liberty and frameworks like Spring Boot, make Java perfectly suited for building microservices too.

* [Node.js ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/runtimes/nodejs/getting-started.html){: new_window}
{: #node notoc}

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient, excelling in throughput and scalability for Web applications, backend-for-front-end patterns, and microservices. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, provides access to a large collection of open source modules, providing a wide range of capabilities to accelerate your application development.


* [Swift ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/runtimes/swift/getting-started.html){: new_window}
{: #swift notoc}

Swift is a modern programming language that was created by Apple in 2014 that was designed to replace the use of Objective C and open-sourced in December of 2015. Today, it is used to build iOS, macOS, web services, and systems software on Linux and macOS operating systems that use the x86, ARM, or z/Architecture. It writes like a scripting language but is compiled to gain C-like high performance with low overhead that makes it ideal for cloud runtimes. It uses a strong and static type system that you see in Java but the functional style and asynchronous routines that you see in JavaScript. It performs well, and the source compiles to native code that uses the LLVM compiler toolchain and can use foreign system libraries that are written in C easily.

* [Python ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/runtimes/python/getting-started.html){: new_window}
{: #python notoc}

Python is a general-purpose, interpreted programming language that puts emphasis on readability. Because of this, Python allows programmers implement functions with fewer lines of code than might be required in other languages. FeaturFeatures in the language makessible to write object-oriented, functional, or imperative code. Python is commonly used for processing of natural language tasks.
